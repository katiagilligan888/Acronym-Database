Acronym Database Instructions

The server and SQL db are deployed on Heroku, so all data will currently persist

In order to load the application:

1. Clone the Git repository
2. Make sure you have Node installed on your machine
3. CD into acronym-db-frontend. Run npm i 
4. Once installation of all packages is complete, run npm start in the acronym-db-frontend 
5. Your Acronym database should be running in localhost:3000 in the browser.

Currently we are missing delete and edit functionality but that will be added in future iterations of backend deployments
